# Execution Log

Chronological execution records for RIC Framework repository work.

## 2026-04-25 - RIC-001A

Actor: Execution Agent

Task: RIC-001A - Add Agent Governance and Recovery Control

Status: DONE by Trigger approval

## Work Performed

- Read available boot files in the required order.
- Confirmed `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ops/boot-rules.md`, and `docs/ops/session-handoff.md` existed as untracked files from prior Trigger-requested edits.
- Created canonical operational files `STATUS.md` and `backlog.md`.
- Created `docs/ops/execution-log.md`.
- Created `docs/ops/decisions.md`.
- Updated `docs/ops/session-handoff.md` for crash recovery.

## Commands Executed

- `Get-Content README.md`
- `if (Test-Path STATUS.md) { Get-Content STATUS.md }`
- `if (Test-Path backlog.md) { Get-Content backlog.md }`
- `if (Test-Path docs\ops\session-handoff.md) { Get-Content docs\ops\session-handoff.md }`
- `if (Test-Path docs\ops\decisions.md) { Get-Content docs\ops\decisions.md }`
- `if (Test-Path docs\ops\execution-log.md) { Get-Content docs\ops\execution-log.md }`
- `git status --short`
- `Get-Content AGENTS.md`
- `Get-Content docs\ops\boot-rules.md`

## Validation Evidence

- `git status` showed untracked files limited to `AGENTS.md`, `STATUS.md`, `backlog.md`, and `docs/ops/` before staging.
- `rg --files` listed no `package.json`, backend application, frontend application, CLI, dependency manifest, or automation script added by RIC-001A.
- Commit created: `b297a2e docs: add agent governance and recovery controls`.
- Post-commit `git status` result was clean: `nothing to commit, working tree clean`.

## Closure Decision

The Trigger approved formal closure of RIC-001A as DONE on 2026-04-25.

## Risks or Gaps

- No RIC-001A closure blocker remains.
- No push was authorized.

## Next Action

Recommend the next backlog candidate: align `README.md` with the canonical governance and recovery control files.
